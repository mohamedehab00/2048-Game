# 2048-Game
This project consists of developing and implementing a computer program that plays 2048 game by a player.
2048 is a single-player puzzle game, in which the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a
grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. It can be regarded as a type
of sliding block puzzle, and is very similar to the Threes! app released a month earlier.
Due to the massive popularity of 2048, many people now mistakenly believe Threes! to be
a clone of it, rather than the other way around.
